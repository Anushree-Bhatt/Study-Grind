    @RequestMapping("/say-hello-jsp")
    public String sayHelloJsp(){
        return "say_hello";  //Actual path : src/resources/META-INf/resources/WEB-INF/jsp/say_hello.jsp
    }

    Say there are multiple jsp files:-
    src/resources/META-INF/resources/WEB-INF/jsp/login.jsp
    src/resources/META-INF/resources/WEB-INF/jsp/welcome.jsp
    src/resources/META-INf/resources/WEB-INF/jsp/to_do.jsp
    src/resources/META-INF/resources/WEB-INF/jsp/say_hello.jsp

    so we can create a shortcut to src/resources/META-INf/resources/WEB-INF/jsp/ in application.properties
    prefix = src/resources/META-INF/resources/WEB-INF/jsp/
    suffix = .jsp
    And you have to configure them using @ConfigurationProperty method.

    Eazy!
    using Spring mvc :
    spring.mvc.view.prefix = /WEB-INF/jsp/
    spring.mvc.view.suffix = .jsp

    note: spring.mvc.view -> points to src/resources/META-INF/resources location by default
